# Basketball-Hololens2

Hololens Basketball is an augmented reality project, made for the Microsoft Hololens 2 device, which has the objective of simulating the experience of playing basketball with a ball and a court, as it would be done in real life.

The purpose of the game is to bring a realistic experience of the sport anywhere, without the need for a hoop, backboard, ball, or even space. Additionally, being able to handle the ball from a distance and change its size with your hands gives a new and innovative feel to the traditional game.

The game is designed for people of any age, who are fit for continuous use of the device. The possibilities are many. Undoubtedly, creativity is the only limit to the fun in this type of simulator. The user does not need to have skill with a ball, or be tall to dunk on a court like a professional. In addition, the interaction of the ball with the medium can provide simple entertainment where there was none before.

As a basketball lover, I know how annoying it can be to want to practice with a ball in an enclosed space and for other people to be bothered by the noise or worried about the possible damage that the ball can cause. For this reason, I hope that this simulator is a great alternative for those of us who want to enjoy this sport without leaving home or work. I hope you enjoy this as much as I do.
